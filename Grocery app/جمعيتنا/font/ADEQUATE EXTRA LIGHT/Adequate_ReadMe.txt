Adequate is a basic geometric sans serif typeface comprising 6 weights plus a free italic with each. The family has modern, workaday letterforms with a tall x-height for clarity and legibility. Adequate does the job; it doesn’t claim to be beautiful and lacks the fashionable mannerisms of many contemporary faces, but there is something timeless, perhaps elegant, about its mathematical simplicity.
